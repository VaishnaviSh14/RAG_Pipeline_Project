Langchain Introduction
LangChain is a powerful framework designed to help developers build applications with large language models (LLMs). It enables seamless integration of LLMs with data sources such as documents, APIs, and databases.

With LangChain, you can implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which combines document retrieval with LLMs to produce accurate and context-aware answers.

This framework supports various document loaders, text splitting, vector stores, and chaining methods to create sophisticated NLP applications.
